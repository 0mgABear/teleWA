4. This is not a problem confined to Singapore, but presents a serious public health problem for healthcare providers and for MOH.

# Problem Statement:

The widespread habit of forwarding misinformation—such as unverified medical advice and unproven remedies—can mislead recipients and result in potentially harmful health decisions. For healthcare providers and local authorities (MOH), combating misinformation is a top priority, as it can create unnecessary fear and significantly hinder efforts to disseminate accurate medical information and guidance to the public.

# Proposed Solution:

## First Iteration: 18.02.2025

Proof-of-concept to retrieve data from Telegram API - working. ✅

## Second Iteration : 18.02.2025

Proof-of-concept to demonstrate ability to forward messages wholesale (full messages) - working. ✅

19.02.2025
Minor updates to code to include flexibility for telegram username.

## Third Iteration: 19.02.2025

Elucidating project background and problem statement.

## Future Integration (Suggestions):

1. Integration with Postman (no access due to access being limited to gov.sg personnel) - to send registered, trustworthy SMS from gov.sg.
